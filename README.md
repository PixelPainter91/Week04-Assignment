Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required 🎯 What requirements did you achieve? Thanks to the recordings all of them, i believe.

 🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? n/a
 
 🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? all of them.
 
 Optional 🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:
The recordings really saved me on this assignment, although understand the individual parts the sum of all the elements is where i get confused. I've carved some time out this weekend to spend going through the recordings and consolidating my learning before the group project next week.


Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission. What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)? -->


 What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them? What went really well and what could have gone better?
 I named my table in supabase guestbkTable and for a good few hours I was trying to figure out why i was getting an error so i tried writing sql polices for select until eventually i renamed the table and any referrences to it in my code, this solved the problem immidately.
